The American Radiator Building (since renamed to the American Standard Building) is a landmark skyscraper located at 40 West 40th Street, in midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was conceived by the architects John Howells and Raymond Hood in 1924 and built for the American Radiator Company.

The building's structural form is based on Eliel Saarinen's unbuilt competition entry for the Tribune Tower, augmented with a strong use of color.

[History and Description](https://architectuul.com/architecture/american-radiator-building)
The architects combined Gothic and modern styles in the design of the building. Black brick on the frontage of the building (symbolizing coal) was selected to give an idea of solidity and to give the building a solid mass. Other parts of the facade were covered in gold bricks (symbolizing fire), and the entry was decorated with marble and black mirrors. Once again, the talents of Rene Paul Chambellan were employed by Howells and Hood for the ornamentation and sculptures.
