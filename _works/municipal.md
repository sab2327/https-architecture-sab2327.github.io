Architect: William M. Kendall of McKim Mead & White
History: It is also the first building to incorporate a New York City Subway station into its base. 
The limestone building incorporates Roman, Italian Renaissance and Classical styles of architecture. A major feature in the design is an open plaza, screened by Corinthian columns, that appears to be carved out of the first three stories of the structure.  The plaza flows into a central triumphal arch, inspired by the Arch of Constantine in Rome, Italy. So grand is the arch that automobile traffic flowed through it before Chambers Street traffic patterns were altered.
