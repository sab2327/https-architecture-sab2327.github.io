Architect: **William M. Kendall** of **McKim Mead & White**

History: It is also the first building to incorporate a New York City Subway station into its base. 
The limestone building incorporates Roman, Italian Renaissance and Classical styles of architecture. A major feature in the design is an open plaza, screened by Corinthian columns, that appears to be carved out of the first three stories of the structure.  The plaza flows into a central triumphal arch, inspired by the Arch of Constantine in Rome, Italy. So grand is the arch that automobile traffic flowed through it before Chambers Street traffic patterns were altered.

"The Municipal Building is an impressive Classical skyscraper, rising to a height of 25 stories with a tower above. It represents an effort made by the City, through the use of noted architects and sculptors, to achieve an imposing building of real beauty. The great freestanding screen of columns across the front, enframing a Classical triumphal arch, is truly monumental in scale.

This large building is ingeniously designed to bridge Chambers Street by means of a handsome barrel-vaulted passageway. It also is notable that such a large building has been able to utilize such a small site so effectively. The open area at the south side, where the building is raised on stilts, equals in concept many contemporary structures.
