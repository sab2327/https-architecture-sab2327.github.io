Architect: Townsend, Steinle & Haskell; neo-Renaissance

In 1906 Townsend partnered with architects Albert Steinle and William Cook Haskell to form Townsend, Steinle & Haskell.  The firm focused on designing large apartment buildings.The end bays above the rusticated three-story base sat behind stone balconies, their architrave frames capped with classical pediments.  The motif was copied at the tenth floor with bronze-railed balconies.  While the two-story entrance was squarely on West 91st Street, it took the address of 640 West End Avenue.   The doorway sat between two polished granite columns within an intricately carved frame.  The framing of the opening directly above was equally elaborate, its columns being of colored marble.
