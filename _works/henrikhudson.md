380 Riverside Drive; Rouse & Sloan
This grandiose Tuscan-style building resides on Riverside Drive from 110th Street to 111th Street, overlooking the majestic Hudson River. This eight-story Italianate villa was named after the riverâ€™s original explorer, Hendrik Hudson, and was ahead of its time in design and function. Architects Rouse and Sloan incorporated deeply recessed exterior courtyards to provide light and ventilation throughout all areas of the apartments. 
The exterior is opulently adorned with period ironwork on the balconies, swaged garlands on the facade, and two frieze of Hermes holding up each side of the main entry. Only one of the magnificent rooftop towers remains intact. The lobby is in keeping with the Italian design and features white marble floors and walls, a coffered ceiling, and a central fountain. The lower level of the building once housed a cafe, beauty parlor, and billiard hall
