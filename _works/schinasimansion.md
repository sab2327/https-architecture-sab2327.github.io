Address: 351 Riverside Drive
Architect: William B. Tuthill

Built in 1909 for Morris Schinasi, an immigrant from Turkey who made a fortune importing Turkish cigarettes with his brother. 

White Vermont marble, bronze balcony grills

"This two-and-a-half-story building is basically rectangular in plan, accented by an interplay of projected and recessed wall sections. The flush entrance facade, facing Riverside Drive, is pierced by windows on each floor. The main doorway, located to the right, is approached by steps flanked by wing walls. These wing walls terminate in high, square, newel posts that, in turn, connect
with the balustraded yard railing.

High French windows, which open onto elaborate stone balconies, appear at the second floor on either side of the main entrance. The balconies are tied in with a broadband course, which separates the two principal stories on all four sides. The long 107th Street facade is composed of end sections and a recessed central section. The one, nearest Riverside Drive, contains a two-story bay surmounted by an ornamented parapet. The rear facade has a three-sided copper oriel at the second story.

The north facade of the house, which faces the neighboring building on Riverside Drive, has the most elaborate treatment. At the rear, there is a two-story oriel set above basement level. A broad first-story bay occupies the central portion ' of the facade. The steeply pitched tile roof rises from the lefthand side of this bay, while a vertical wall with windows is set slightly back from the right-hand side. The rest of the north facade accords with the front of the building.

The dominant feature of this handsome design is to be found in the use of boldly projecting dormer windows set above the modillioned roof cornice and its paneled frieze. These dormers, which appear on all four sides, are composed of ornate pilasters with stone panels in the upper half, crowned by high curvilinear pediments. The picturesque quality of these dormers is complemented by a pitched roof of green terracotta tile, which is surmounted, at the front of the building, by a cresting and two spiked finials."
