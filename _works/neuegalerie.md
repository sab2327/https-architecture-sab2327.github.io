Also known as: William Starr Miller House 
Address: 1048 5th Avenue; 
Architect: Carrere & Hastings
On an avenue lined with marble and limestone chateaux and palazzos, many of them dripping with scrolled brackets, swags and garlands, Starr’s mansion was quietly restrained in comparison. The house sat on a rusticated base, the central three bays projecting from the bulk of the structure. A high slate mansard roof with tall stone-framed dormers sat behind a limestone balustrade.
As the mansion neared completion The New York Times commented on the atypical choice of style and materials on December 7, 1913.  “There is a dignity and simplicity far more pleasing than some of the excruciatingly ornate creations on the avenue,” the newspaper said.  “The use of red brick with limestone adds a cheerful touch of color suggestive of early Colonial to the Miller house.”  The New York Times added that the new house would be “of more than ordinary importance.
