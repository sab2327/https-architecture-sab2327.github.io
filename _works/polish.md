Address:
Architect: C. P. H. Gilbert
The Poles acquired this building...marked a stark departure from Gilbert's traditional style of French Gothic architecture and was instead robustly Beaux-Arts, heavy with rusticated stonework, balconies, and a colossal mansard roof. (https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/realestate/14scapes.html)
