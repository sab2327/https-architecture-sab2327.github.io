Address: 2171 Broadway at W 77th Street
Architect: Emory Roth

The original design included a domed turret on the corner, which was removed in the â€™50s.

"The Hotel Belleclaire of 1901-03 with its references to the Art Nouveau and Secessionist movements of Europe, represents not only an interesting early phase in Roth's career, but also a fascinating stylistic anomaly in the history of New York City architecture."
