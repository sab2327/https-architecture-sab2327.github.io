330 Riverside Drive; A grand Parisian mansion, it stretched eastward along West 105th Street and turned a shoulder to its less impressive neighbors.  The architects blended exquisitely carved limestone with buff-colored brick to produce a restrained and elegant design.   Ornamentation was reserved, on the whole, for the window openings while large areas of fa√ßade were purposefully left blank.
