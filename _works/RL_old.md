"The Waldo mansion is a fine example of the neo-French Renaissance style, generally associated with Francois I. Based on the 16th-century chateaux of the Loire Valley, this style was introduced to New York by the renowned Paris-trained architect, Richard Morris Hunt, who designed the first Fifth Avenue chateau for Mr. and Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt in 1879. The great vogue for this style, which was used primarily for private residences, led to its adoption by many architects, including Kimball and his partner Thompson, despite the fact that both were closely associated with British architectural currents.

The Waldo mansion, constructed in limestone with red roofs accented by copper dormers, cresting and finials, is four and one
half stories in height. The main facade on Madison Avenue is symmetrically designed in a tripartite composition with project~
ng end bays and a slightly projecting central bay at the second and third stories, which originally emphasized the main entry at
the first floor. The first story now has smooth walls punctuated by round-arched doorways and large shop windows. The upper floors display the handsome and elaborate carved ornament which characterizes the neo-French Renaissance style. The projecting end bays have square-headed windows with stone mullions and transom bars flanked by slim pilasters with composite capitals. Panels beneath
the windows are ornamented by cartouches surrounded with wreaths and fluttering ribbons. At the second and third floors a series of five deeply recessed round-arched windows set behind very richly carved, open-work balustrades suggest galleries somewhat like those of the Chateau de Blois. 

The windows have scroll keystones, disks in the spandrels, and are framed by slim pilasters, except in the central bay which has smooth columns. Four canopied stone niches which contain statuettes depicting saints appear at the second story between the windows, and cartouche-like ornaments, two with the inscription "A.D. 1895" adorn the walls at the third story flanking the central window. At the fourth story ~? square-headed windows flanked by dwarf columns are set behind a carved balustrade similar in design to that of the second story. These windows are on either side of the high central stone dor.mer which rises up in front ·of the steep roof of the house. '.rhis ornate dormer is in two tiers with columns flanking the windows. A lunette above the larger window contains foliat e ornament ·surrounding a shield, while the smaller window is flanked and crowned by finials. Two smaller stone dormers rise up in front of the hipped roofs at the end bays of the building and two tall stone chimneys with diamond patterned carving are set between small copper dormers. These dormers and chimneys, reminiscent of those of the Chateau de Chambord, impart a lively and picturesque silhouette to the roofline of the building.

The Seventy-Second Street facade of the mansion is dominated by a broad projecting curved bay at the second and third stories surmounted by a balustrade. Both stories contain triple squareheaded windows with stone mullions and transom bars at the c:enter of the bay flanked by similar double windows. Beneath the windows are friezes with richly enframed cartouches at the second story and at the third story square panels flanked by putti issuing from foliage. canopied niches like those on the main facade flank the windows at the second story. A great two-tiered stone dormer, very similar to the central dormer of the main facade, extends up from the fourth floor into the roof.

Although the Waldo mansion is modeled on French 16th century chateaux, its reduced scale and urban setting result in a characteristically late 19th century American architectural creation. The wealthy and socially prominent of New York considered themselves rivals of European aristocracy. As such, it was only fitting that they live in residences of palatial grandeur. The Waldo mansion is one of the finest of these great residences, an adroit adaptation of French Renaissance architecture to late 19th century American taste."
